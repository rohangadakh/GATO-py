This is the GATO.py ( Game Automation Python ) project. This project is just a base concept for game automation using python code. Okay Okay, I know that this code is not going to truly automate the game, but using this code you can play the game on your voice command.  

IMPORTANT - 
1. This code currently works only for Hill Climb Racing. 
2. This code uses mouse clicks to Speed and Break the car. So as I mentioned in the code, the you have to check the mouse position and the position of the GAS and BREAK button for the game according to the podition of the GAS and BREAK button make changes in it.  

COMMANDS - 
To speed up the car, say SPEED. 
For breaking or reversing the car, say BREAK. 
To exit from the code, say QUIT.
